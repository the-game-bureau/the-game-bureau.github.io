-- walking-tour-prompt-import.sql
--
-- Imports a WHOLE WALKING PATH into three tables:
--
--   public.waypoints    the places. ONE ROW PER PLACE, reused if already held.
--   public.paths       the path: its id, title, shape, city.
--   public.path_stops  nothing but ids and a position.
--
-- (No backticks in this file. mc/data/waypoints.html pastes it verbatim into a
--  String.raw template literal, and one backtick ends the template.)
--
-- IT REUSES A PLACE IT ALREADY HAS, and that is the important difference from
-- the version this replaces. Until 2026-08-08 a path lived in columns ON the
-- waypoint, so importing a second downtown Miami walk inserted a SECOND Freedom
-- Tower - unlinked to the first, a second pin on one building, and no way to ask
-- what paths a place was on. Now the place is looked up by name + address and
-- the new path simply points at it.
--
-- MATCHING IS ON NAME + ADDRESS, NEVER ADDRESS ALONE. One address is routinely
-- several stops: 100 W 14th Ave Pkwy in Denver is the Denver Art Museum and the
-- Scottish Angus Cow and Calf and Big Sweep and Monolith; 206 Washington St in
-- Boston is the Old State House and the Boston Massacre Site. Matching on
-- address alone would silently merge places that are genuinely different.
--
-- The description of a REUSED place is left exactly as it was. The incoming
-- sentence is discarded, and the returned note says so. That is the accepted
-- cost of one row per place: a stop reads the same on every path it is on, and
-- a path cannot quietly rewrite a sentence another path depends on.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER: a human runs it under their own admin session. Writes to all
-- three tables are gated behind the authenticated role, so nothing here is
-- callable by anon and no cloud routine can invoke it - the routines commit SQL
-- for a human to run.
--
-- Re-running creates a SECOND path with a new id, which is visible and easy to
-- delete, rather than half-merging into the first.

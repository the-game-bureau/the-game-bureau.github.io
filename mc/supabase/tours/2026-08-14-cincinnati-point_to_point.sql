-- TGB NFL Tour Builder
-- City: Cincinnati, OH (fanbase city of the Bengals); had zero rows in public.routes,
--   never previously built by this routine, and alphabetically first among the
--   NFL fanbase cities tied on that count.
-- Date: 2026-08-14
-- Shape: point_to_point, 6 stops
-- Distance / time: roughly 0.8 mile one way, about 45-55 minutes including time
--   standing at each stop -- well under the two-hour ceiling.
-- Sports stop: stop 2, the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum at Great
--   American Ball Park (100 Joe Nuxhall Way).
-- Music stop: stop 4, the Taft Theatre (317 E 5th St).
-- Commercial ends: stop 1, Cincinnati Lager House (start, 115 Joe Nuxhall Way,
--   riverfront, parking and streetcar nearby) and stop 6, Graeter's Fountain
--   Square (end, 511 Walnut St, a block from the Government Square bus hub).
-- Drawn from: GPSMyCity's "Cincinnati Introduction Walking Tour" (same
--   riverfront-to-Fountain-Square footprint -- Reds Hall of Fame, Freedom
--   Center, Fountain Square) and its "Over-the-Rhine District Walking Tour"
--   (confirms Fountain Square as the hinge between the riverfront and the rest
--   of downtown); individual venue pages verified every address and fact below.
-- Note: Cincinnati Lager House is the 2026 rebrand of the venue long known as
--   Moerlein Lager House -- same building, same beer, new name -- recorded here
--   under its current name.
